                    tasked with maintaining both national and global security.</p>

                    <p className="lead col-8 ">Founded in the wake of the Allied victory over the Axis powers
                        and <b>HYDRA</b> in World War II, S.H.I.E.L.D. was organized to protect the United States
                        from all possible threats. With its advanced weapons and extraordinary agents, S.H.I.E.L.D.
                        was maybe the greatest military power on Earth. Following his encounter with <b>Captain
                            Marvel</b>, S.H.I.E.L.D. was run by Nick Fury and the World Security Council in the modern
                        age, S.H.I.E.L.D. had to deal with the significant rise in enhanced individuals,
                        dangerous advanced technology, and alien contact. But all the problems S.H.I.E.L.D.
                        had to solve eventually led to the formation of the Avengers, a response team that
                        was recruited to save the world during the <b>alien invasion of Earth in 2012</b>. The agency
                        became publicly known after the Battle of New York, partially because of the Rising
                        Tide website.</p>

                <p className="lead">In 2014, through the actions of Black Widow and Nick Fury, the
                    world became aware of the fact that S.H.I.E.L.D. was infiltrated and largely controlled
                    by HYDRA. After the battle in which S.H.I.E.L.D.'s primary headquarters, the Triskelion,
                    was heavily damaged, all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s classified files were dumped on the Internet,
                    and the agency was disavowed by the United States government and labeled a terrorist
                    organization. Many S.H.I.E.L.D. officials were taken into custody and subjected to rigorous
                    questioning. However, despite the massive manhunt on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s agents, a few
                    operatives scattered across the world in most secret bases remained loyal to their
                    oath, saving the most necessary technology for future use. But the team most responsible
                    for the survival of S.H.I.E.L.D. was the team of Agent Phil Coulson, who valiantly led
                    his teammates against the forces of HYDRA led by the traitors John Garrett and Grant Ward,
                    winning the battle in which Garrett's plan ultimately failed. After that battle, Fury
                    appointed <b>Phil Coulson</b> the  <b>new director of S.H.I.E.L.D.</b> and tasked him with rebuilding
                    the agency from scratch.

                    In 2014, Fury trains Rogers to be a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent and proposes Project Insight: three
                    S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarriers armed with spy satellite guided guns, designed to preemptively
                    eliminate threats. The Helicarriers are capable of continuous suborbital flight, due to
                    new Repulsor engines proposed by Stark, their guns can kill 1,000 targets per minute,
                    and the satellites, launched from the Lemurian Star, a S.H.I.E.L.D. vessel, can read a
                    target's DNA anywhere in the world. However, when the project is a few weeks away from
                    completion, Fury grows suspicious about Insight. He hires an Algerian mercenary, Georges
                    Batroc, to hijack the Star as cover to allow Romanoff onto the ship with Rogers to retrieve
                    data regarding Insight. Though Romanoff is successful, Fury is unable to decrypt
                    the data, increasing his suspicions and forcing him to convince Pierce to delay the
                    project. Shortly afterwards, an attempt is made on Fury's life by Hydra, which is
                    revealed to have taken over S.H.I.E.L.D. Fury is apparently killed by their most
                    dangerous assassin, the Winter Soldier, but he is revealed to have faked his death using
                    Tetrodotoxin B, a drug designed by Banner that was capable of slowing down the heart
                    to 1 beat per minute. Rogers, Sam Wilson, and Romanoff are taken by Hill to see him alive
                    and in a hidden bunker. After it is revealed that Pierce is working for Hydra, Fury
                    reappears to override Hydra's control of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s computer systems, forcing Pierce
                    to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D's database so Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing
                    Hydra to the public. Fury reveals that although Pierce had deleted Fury's retinal scan
                    from the system, Fury had a backup scan of his destroyed other eye. He then tells Rogers,
                    Wilson, and Romanoff that he is to go into hiding in Europe to hunt down more Hydra cells.

                        Once Hydra's plan to control the world is foiled, Fury appears to assist S.H.I.E.L.D.
                        agents in the aftermath of those events, rescuing agents Leo Fitz and Jemma Simmons
                        from drowning in the ocean and providing Agent Coulson with the Destroyer gun to take
                        out enemy soldiers, before they confront John Garrett and Deathlok. In the aftermath,
                        Coulson vaporizes Garrett and criticizes Fury for using GH325 to revive him. Fury
                        responds that he values Coulson as much as any Avenger, because he represents the
                        heart and moral center of S.H.I.E.L.D., and declares Coulson the new director of
                        S.H.I.E.L.D., tasking him with rebuilding the organization from scratch, and equips
                        him with a 'toolbox' containing useful data.

                        In 2015, Fury arrives at Barton's home to help and motivate Stark, Rogers,
                        Romanoff, Banner, and Barton to formulate a plan to stop Ultron. He,
                        Hill, and other former agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and James Rhodes use the
                        original helicarrier to help the Avengers in Sokovia during the final
                        battle against Ultron. Afterwards, he oversees the Avengers transition
                        into the new Avengers Compound.

                        Coulson subsequently reveals to Gonzalez and his board that he and
                        Fury had discovered that the original helicarrier survived HYDRA's
                        attack and repaired it as a failsafe in case of an emergency.
